# MINESWEEPER - Roopesh
This is the classic minesweeper game which I have played many times but never knew how to play. Finally, I figured it out and here is my game project build with **C++**.
## Project Structure
To make this game - 

 1. Project consist of Header Files and Program Files.
  2. The files are of - 
	 a. **Grid** - This consist data of Grid and check for win/lose and opening grid cells
	 b. **Cells** - This consist data of each cell and to store cell state/type and row/column value
	 c. **State** - This consist of game state and to set/get current game state.

3. Docs folder consist of doxygen file where you can read the class and function definition.
## Rules
Minesweeper is a classic game which everyone has played but no one knows the rule of! So here are the rules - 

1. You can input between 0-8 as row and column.
2. When the grid opens, you will see numbers on the cell. This number represents the number of mine adjacent to current cell.
3. If you open a mine, then GAME OVER.
4. If you avoid all the mines, then you win.
## How to Play
You can download the **Minesweeper.exe** file and can play the game!!
